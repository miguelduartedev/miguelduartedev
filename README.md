# Hello, I'm Miguel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Front End Developer with over 3 years of experience, originally from Lisbon, Portugal. I specialize in building modern and interactive web applications using the following technologies:

- Front End Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks and Libraries: React, TypeScript, Next.js
- State Management: Redux Toolkit
- Styling: SCSS

## ðŸš€ Projects

Here are some personal projects I've worked on:

- [Interactive Maps](https://interactive-maps.vercel.app/): Interactive Maps is a custom map making tool that I've worked on out of passion for Maps, Geography and Geopolitics. ðŸ—º
- [Miguel Duarte](https://miguelduartedev.github.io/portfolio/): My very own portfolio website ðŸŽ¨.
- [Ricardo Sousa](https://ricardo-sousa.com/): Portfolio website for a designer and photographer based in Lisbon. (my first freelance side project at a very early stage of my career!)
